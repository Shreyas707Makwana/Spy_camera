# Spy Camera

## Overview

Spy Camera is a software project developed by a group of five individuals for a college assignment. It serves as a motion detection system utilizing a camera feed for security purposes. The application is capable of detecting movements within its field of view and triggering actions based on predefined settings.

## Features

- **Motion Detection**: The software actively monitors the camera feed for any signs of movement.
- **Alerts**: Upon detecting motion, the system can generate alerts, such as notifications or emails, to notify the user.
- **Recording**: Optionally, Spy Camera can record footage when motion is detected for later review.
- **Customization**: Users can adjust various settings, such as sensitivity levels and alert mechanisms, to suit their preferences.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: The interface is designed to be intuitive, allowing users to easily navigate and configure the system.
